These  scripts are used for easy commun

These python scripts form a basic IoT communication protocol where the client 
that controls a physical device (the garage door), is able to send and receive
informations about the system through MQTT messages. More than this, it also
can be configured to accept a custom list of users (see WHITELIST section)
